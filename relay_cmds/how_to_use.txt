Tested hardware: NCD R110PL_ETHERNET relay (1-Channel 10 Amp SPST Relay w/8 CH 8/10 bit ADC)

This folder contains "ProXR" commands for relays from National Control Devices (controlanything.com).  
Hopefully the filenames are self-explanatory. To use, you must first know the IP address and port of
the relay.  The default port is 2101. This isn't at all an exhaustive list of commands, just a few
often-used ones to get started.  Read the ProXR manual at controlanything.com for more details.

Example: IP is 192.168.104.104 Port is 2101

cat relay_ping.hex | nc 192.168.104.104 2101 | hexdump -C

nc is the linux utility netcat (sudo apt-get install netcat on Ubuntu, if required)
The last hexdump converts the relays response from ASCII to hex
This command checks comms with the relay board, if everything is good it responds 0x55
